# Stremio GDrive Addon 

This is a simple addon for Stremio that allows you to watch videos from Google Drive.

It searches your entire Google Drive and any shared drives you have access to for videos and presents them in Stremio.

## Deployment

This addon is designed to be deployed as a worker on Cloudflare Workers.

You can find a full detailed guide on how to deploy this addon [here](https://guides.viren070.me/stremio/addons/stremio-gdrive).

## Configuration 

Although you may modify the code as you wish, I have supplied a `CONFIG` object at the top of the code after `CREDENTIALS` that allows you to easily 
configure some aspects of the addon.

This table explains the configuration options:
